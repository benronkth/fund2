# Continuous integration server (CI server)

This repository includes code for implementing a basic CI server. The implementation offers pulling the code from the git repository, building and testing the code. This project uses the [CI server skeleton](https://github.com/KTH-DD2480/smallest-java-ci) implemented in Java which is called as webhook by Github. The HTTP part of the skeleton is based on Jetty. This project is made for Software Engineering Fundamentals course (DD2480) in KTH.

# Test Execuation
Test execuation is done using Gradle. When the CI server gets a push, new changes are fetched using ```git fetch```. Then the CI server checks out the main branch using ```git checkout main``` and then the code is tested using ```./gradlew test```.
